# Confluence
Extremely basic confluence implementation to quickly write to pages to confluence from any workflow. 

Note that this package is not meant to, nor will it ever be a complete confluence API. 
It's meant as a stable simple way to write a page to confluence using a very minimalistic approach. 

E.g. add any small .php file to any place in a workflow and allow it to post to confluence.
